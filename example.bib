	abstract = {A novel group of hyperthermophilic rod-shaped motile methanogens was isolated from a hydrothermally heated deep sea sediment (Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California) and from a shallow marine hydrothermal system (Kolbeinsey ridge, Iceland). The grew between 84 and 110°C (opt: 98°C) and from 0.2\% to 4\% NaCl (opt. 2\%) and pH 5.5 to 7 (opt: 6.5). The isolates were obligate chemolithoautotrophes using H2/CO2 as energy and carbon sources. In the presence of sulfur, H2S was formed and cells tended to lyse. The cell wall consisted of a new type of pseudomurein containing ornithin in addition to lysine and no N-acetylglucosamine. The pseudomurein layer was covered by a detergent-sensitive protein surface layer. The core lipid consisted exclusively of phytanyl diether. The GC content of the DNA was 60 mol\%. By 16S rRNA comparisons the new organisms were not related to any of the three methanogenic lineages. Based on the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolates, we describe here a new genus, which we name Methanopyrus (the “methane fire”). The type species is Methanopyrus kandleri (type strain: AV19; DSM 6324).},

	abstract = {The recently discovered "hat" aperiodic monotile mixes unreflected and reflected tiles in every tiling it admits, leaving open the question of whether a single shape can tile aperiodically using translations and rotations alone. We show that a close relative of the hat -- the equilateral member of the continuum to which it belongs -- is a weakly chiral aperiodic monotile: it admits only non-periodic tilings if we forbid reflections by fiat. Furthermore, by modifying this polygon's edges we obtain a family of shapes called Spectres that are strictly chiral aperiodic monotiles: they admit only chiral non-periodic tilings based on a hierarchical substitution system.},
